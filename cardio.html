        Cardiovascular fitness refers to a health-related component of physical fitness that is brought about by sustained physical activity.[1] A person's ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is affected by many physiological parameters, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption.[1]

Understanding the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and other categories of conditioning requires a review of changes that occur with increased aerobic, or anaerobic capacity. As aerobic/anaerobic capacity increases, general metabolism rises, muscle metabolism is enhanced, haemoglobin rises, buffers in the bloodstream increase, venous return is improved, stroke volume is improved, and the blood bed becomes more able to adapt readily to varying demands. Each of these results of cardiovascular fitness/cardiorespiratory conditioning will have a direct positive effect on muscular endurance, and an indirect effect on strength and flexibility.[2]

To facilitate optimal delivery of oxygen to the working muscles, an individual needs to train or participate in activities that will build up the energy stores needed for sport. This is referred to as metabolic training. Metabolic training is generally divided into two types: aerobic and anaerobic. A 2005 Cochrane review demonstrated that physical activity interventions are effective for increasing cardiovascular fitness.[3]

Cardiovascular fitness is a measure of how well the heart, lungs, and blood vessels can transport oxygen to the muscles during exercise. It is an important component of overall fitness and has been linked to numerous health benefits, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, improved cognitive function, and increased longevity. A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that higher levels of cardiovascular fitness were associated with a lower risk of mortality from all causes, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.

          <h4> WHY Gym?</h4>
          <p>A gym, short for gymnasium (pl.: gymnasiums or gymnasia), 
            is an indoor venue for exercise and sports. The word is derived
             from the ancient Greek term "gymnasion".[1] They are commonly found 
          an describe a secondary school that preprsity, with or without 
            the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.</p>
